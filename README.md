# BlackJack-Game
This code was a project/lab in an intro to python class (CS 1110) where we built off a previously created lab (a card lab that implemented a class with subclasses of all the cards of the deck) and used this previous lab to make a playable blackjack game. After every run, the code provides an updated message to the player on their score, teh dealers score, and the current situation of the game. This code is a great way to practice your blackjack skills before hitting the casinos.
